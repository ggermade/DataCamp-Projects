# DataCamp-Projects

# Analyzing Super Bowl Data

+ In this project I analyzed historical Super Bowl data, specifically concerning the participating NFL teams, guest artists and TV ratings for the event. Being an Exploratory Data Analysis project, I used python's popular Pandas module to find insights concerning the growth of the Super Bowl over the years, as well as interesting statistics concerning the NFL teams and artists that have made the event every year.
